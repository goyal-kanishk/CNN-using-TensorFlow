# CNN-using-TensorFlow
This repo shows you how to build a CNN using tensorflow.
Convulational Neural Networks (CNN or ConvNet) have applications in fields such as computer vision, image and video recognition, self driving cars etc.
We are using the deep learning TensorFLow to implement this CNN.
Frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch are very useful to learn as we only have to do forward pass in them and they do the back propagation themselves.
This repository is from course 4 of Deep Learning speciliazation on Coursera.
